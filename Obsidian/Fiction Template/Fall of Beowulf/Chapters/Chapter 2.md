"Heorot," I murmur, gazing up at the towering hall before us. Its wooden walls loom like a fortress against the encroaching darkness, its thatched roof crowned with the horns of mighty beasts. But despite its imposing exterior, I sense a pall of unease hanging over the place, a feeling of dread that gnaws at my gut.
"Stay close," I command my companions, drawing my sword from its scabbard with a metallic rasp. "We do not know what awaits us within these walls."
The men nod, their expressions grim as they fan out behind me, weapons at the ready. Together, we approach the massive wooden doors of Heorot, their ancient hinges creaking in protest as we push them open.
The interior of the hall is bathed in flickering firelight, casting long shadows upon the rough-hewn walls. The air is thick with the smell of mead and sweat, and the sound of revelry echoes through the chamber, mingling with the low murmur of voices.
But beneath the facade of merriment, I can sense the tension that pervades the room, the wary glances and hushed whispers that follow our every move. These people know of the threat that lurks in the darkness, and they fear what it may bring.
"Where is King Hrothgar?" I inquire of a nearby warrior, his face drawn and weary.
"He waits for you in his chamber," the man replies, gesturing toward a doorway at the far end of the hall. "But be warned, stranger. The creature that haunts our land is no ordinary foe."
