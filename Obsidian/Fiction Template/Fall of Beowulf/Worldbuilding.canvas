		{"id":"dcd294f8a2ea57af","type":"text","text":"Beowulf\" explores several major themes, but three of the most prominent are:\n\n1. **Heroism and Valor**: The poem celebrates the qualities of bravery, strength, and honor exemplified by its titular hero, Beowulf, as he faces various adversaries, including Grendel, Grendel's mother, and the dragon. Beowulf's willingness to confront these monsters, even at great personal risk, underscores the importance of heroism in Anglo-Saxon culture.\n    \n2. **Good vs. Evil**: Throughout the narrative, Beowulf confronts and defeats malevolent forces threatening society, such as Grendel and the dragon. The struggle between good and evil is a central theme, emphasizing the eternal battle between forces of darkness and the forces of light. Beowulf represents the embodiment of good, while the monsters symbolize chaos and destruction.\n    \n3. **The Passage of Time and Mortality**: As the narrative unfolds, the poem reflects on the fleeting nature of life and the inevitability of death. Beowulf's journey from youthful heroism to aging king highlights the passage of time and the cyclical nature of existence. The poem also grapples with the concept of legacy and the importance of leaving behind a heroic reputation that will endure beyond one's lifetime.","x":1020,"y":520,"width":560,"height":926},

This ending explores themes of mortality and the inevitability of change.","x":1640,"y":-100,"width":560,"height":740},
