Hi friends! 
## Hope this template is helpful! 
This has all my presets pre-enabled, which hides everything that doesn't fit *my* writing workflow. Re-enable them from the Settings if they don't work for you. 
You can clear out the demo data, rename the folder, and clone it for your own projects! 
I've updated the .CSS stylesheet to be more descriptive, so it's easier to edit. 
I've also left in a plugin that I use called Advanced Merger: in one click you can merge all your chapters into a single file to export elsewhere.
Send me a message with your ideas! I'd love to hear how you're getting along with this tool. legendfiction.com
